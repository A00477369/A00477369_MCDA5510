## About Me
Hi! My name is Neeyati. I am an inquisitive software developer with an immense interest in Big Data. I completed a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Applications with a strong foundation in Math and Programming Logic. After graduating, I also pursued and successfully completed a Post Graduate Diploama in Data Analysis. I believe Computer Science can pave the way for a more equitable world. I aspire to explore the unique and creative approaches toward technology which can help advance the world. I am dedicated and keen to work hard in this field to further my ambitions and become a professional Data Scientist.

## Common Interest
Hritik, Zaid and I teamed up for this assignment. Belonging to the same country, it was easier to find things in common. At first, we chatted about our movie tastes and our favourite ways to kill time. Funnily enough, all of us watch stand-up comedy a lot. We dived into discussing our beloved comedians and even swapped recommendations for the funniest stand-up bits. Somehow, our conversation diverted towards food, and we also realised that we share a liking for spicy food and decided to visit some of the local Indian restaurant together sometime soon. It is safe to say this assignment has turned into a fantastic bonding experience.
